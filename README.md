### While Loops

Answer each of the following questions in a separate Python file named `hw10-3-#.py` where `#` is the number of the question. In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file.


Select any 3 questions from HW 10-2 and rewrite the functions so that they use a while loop instead of a for loop.
